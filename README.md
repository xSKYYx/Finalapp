——recipe app (cook book ) —

This app is intended to allow users to go and view recipes that they created . They can create recipes in the create recipes page that takes a name of the recipe (food) , 
the ingredients , then the instructions 

 Once those text fields are entered into a database that then is post to display the information in the current recipe page, however I’ve have so many attempts in trying to solve how
 to display data over pages with navigation but it wasn’t working for me. The data does store in the Data base like it’s post to but it won’t display across pages …..
 it will if it’s in the same page as the database is created ! 



———online recipe references———

Users can also view the online references page to get ideas of what create for a recipe

——-about page ——-

Just a page displaying about us — the creator of the app and the version of the app … random information 

--------problems----------
the database works but doesnt because the problem was having the data display or navigate between screens which it wasnt and i had trouble trying to figure out how to do 
that without making everything crash.

- apk : i try to upload the apk but it say something with my git and i wish i had more time to figure this out but no.

-------images/design----

------additional libraries----
